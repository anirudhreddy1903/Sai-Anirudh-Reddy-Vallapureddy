🌌 Sai Anirudh Reddy Vallapureddy — Generative AI Engineer | Agentic Systems | Full-Stack ML
Hi! I’m Sai Anirudh Reddy, a Software & AI Engineer focused on building production-grade Agentic AI systems, LLM-powered automation, and end-to-end GenAI applications that integrate seamlessly with real business platforms.

I bring together backend engineering, LLM orchestration, retrieval pipelines, and cloud infrastructure to create intelligent, scalable systems that reduce manual toil and operate reliably in enterprise environments.

🚀 About Me
I'm an engineer with 5+ years of experience across:

⚙️ High-scale microservices (Java/Spring Boot, Kafka, REST)
📡 Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Snowflake)
🤖 LLM-driven automation & agent workflows
📊 Distributed stream processing & observability
🛠️ CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Jenkins, Vite, Docker)
My recent work focuses heavily on agentic AI, self-healing systems, and LLM integrations—building solutions that reason, act, and fix problems autonomously.

I enjoy designing systems where traditional backend reliability meets cutting-edge GenAI.
